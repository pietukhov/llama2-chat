# ðŸ¦™ðŸ’¬ Llama 2 Chat

This chatbot is created using the [**Llama 2**](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) model, an open source large language model released by Meta.

Particularly, we're using the [**Llama-7B**](https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama7b-v2-chat) model deployed by the Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) team and hosted on the [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) platform.

This app was refactored from [a16z's implementation](https://github.com/a16z-infra/llama2-chatbot) to be light weight for deployment to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
